# CS-IHU-NotifierBot

This bot is used in the first semester CompSci Discord Server.

It's made to fit that particular server, but with some changes it can be made to fit multiple servers.


## Installation

You can build the package using docker. If you don't want to use docker you can run

```bash
python -m csihu.main
```

after you have installed all dependencies with `poetry install`.
